# Trash Bandits Recycled

Play as a cat and raccoon trying to steal ~~delicious~~ trash! A collaborative two-player game originally developed as part of MIT's CMS.611 Creating Video Games course.

While originally a group project, I continued solo after the class ended to add more polish.

- Play the game on itch.io [here]([url](https://jmfortt.itch.io/trash-bandits-recycled))
